# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer

A recursive function is a function that calls itself many times over before returning a final result. Recursive functions have two cases, a base case which stops the function from calling itself infinitely and a recursive case which is where the function calls itself.
